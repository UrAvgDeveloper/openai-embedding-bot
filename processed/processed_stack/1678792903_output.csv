connections,"connections. Some webpages can connect to your wallet and enable interactions that are otherwise not possible. !!! example By default, the fetch ledger browser at https://browse-fetchhub.fetch.ai/validators only shows a list of active validators for the Fetch network along with some staking-related details (e.g. the validators' commission rates and number of delegated FETs). However if you have your wallet set up on the browser, you will see a button for connecting your wallet in the top right of the page, and if you do, you will get the option of staking your FETs with any of the validators on the list and accessing your staking dashboard. To learn more, visit the staking guide at https://docs.fetch.ai/basics/staking/how_to_stake/. If you view such webpages using a browser with the Fetch wallet, you will see additional options. If you use a browser with no wallet, those options will not be shown. You can manage these connections on the wallet: 1. From the wallet dashboard, click the icon in the top left, then **Settings**. 2. Click on **Manage Connections**. !!! info Here you will see a list of webpages which have been connected to your wallet. Visiting these pages will not ask you for a connection with your wallet again; the page will automatically connect. You have the option of removing and thus revoking these connections. If you do, the next time you visit that page, it will not automatically connect to your wallet. 3. To remove a connection, click the icon on the connection you wish to remove."
Recover Migrated Ethereum Account,"Recover Migrated Ethereum Account. # Recover Migrated Ethereum Account Prior to the transition to our native Cosmos SDK-based ledger, ERC20 FETs staked using accounts on Ethereum were migrated to native accounts on the Fetch main network. These accounts correspond to the private key of their associated Ethereum accounts. These native accounts can be accessed by transforming the original Ethereum keypair into a native Fetch keypair and address: 1. On the welcome page at ./account_management.md#welcome-page, click **Migrate from ETH**. 2. In the next page, click **Migrate a Metamask Private Key**. 3. Enter the address and private key of the Ethereum account which staked ERC20 FETs. 4. Give your account a name and set a password if one is not set (i.e. if it is the first time you open the wallet, or in case you have removed all of your accounts). The password will be used the next time you want to use the wallet or make important changes to your account. Hit **Next**."
deposit,"deposit. To transfer funds to your account on the Fetch wallet: In the wallet or application you are using to send the funds, use your account's address as the destination account to which the funds must go. ### To copy your account's address 1. Ensure you are logged into the wallet. 2. Either click on the account address at the top of the dashboard (under the account name): 3. Or select **Deposit** and scan the QR code. Once you send the tokens, the balance should be updated. !!! failure If your origin wallet says that the address (which should start with """") is invalid, it is probably expecting an Ethereum address (beginning with """") and is most likely trying to send ERC20 FET. In this case, you need to use the token bridge at https://token-bridge.fetch.ai/ to swap your ERC20 FET for native FET. !!! warning You should **not** send ERC20 FET to this wallet. If you do, you will lose your tokens. The Fetch wallet can only hold native FET tokens and not ERC20 FET tokens."
address_book,"address_book. The Fetch wallet's **Address Book** makes it easy to transfer funds to accounts you frequently use. To add an address to the address book: 1. From the wallet dashboard click the icon in the top left, then **Address Book**. 2. Select the network this address belongs to, then **+ Add New**. 4. Fill in the details: * **Name**: the name you give to this account * **Address**: the account's address * **Default memo**: the memo used by default when sending funds to this account 5. Hit **Save**. !!! tip When sending funds, instead of writing the address of the recipient you can hit the icon to the right to select an account from the address book."
stake,"stake. Clicking the **Stake** button on the Fetch wallet dashboard opens the Fetch ledger browser at https://browse-fetchhub.fetch.ai/validators.

From the wallet dashboard, select **Claim**. !!! info This will claim the total rewards accrued for your stakes across every validator. 3. The wallet shows you a summary of the transaction. Review it, select a transaction fee, and if you are happy, hit **Approve** to complete the operation. You should now see the rewards added to your **Total Balance**. !!! info To claim rewards from each validator individually, see the claim rewards using the staking dashboard at https://docs.fetch.ai/basics/staking/how_to_stake/#using-the-staking-dashboard."
